Here’s a short explanation of each HTTP request header:

Accept: */*

This tells the server that the client can accept any type of response (*/* means "any media type").
It is often used when the client doesn’t specify a particular response format.

Content-Type: application/fhir+json

This indicates that the request body is in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) format using JSON.
The server expects the request payload to be structured according to FHIR JSON standards.
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

This tells the server that the client supports compressed responses to save bandwidth.
It lists the compression methods the client can handle:

gzip: A common compression format.
deflate: A lightweight compression algorithm.
br (Brotli): A newer, more efficient compression method (commonly used with HTTPS).

The Authorization: Basic header is used for HTTP Basic Authentication, where the client sends a username and password to authenticate with the server.


Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_credentials>
Where:

<base64_encoded_credentials> is a Base64-encoded string of "username:password".

echo -n "myUser:myPassword" | base64
